THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO POST ANSWERS TO THE
SECURITY STRATEGY COURSE.

这里不是发布 Github 安全课程答案的地方！
如果您在这里提交诸如“2.6.9”之类的答案，那您就错了！
在此处发布您的答案将导致您被永久禁止！

IF YOU ARE HERE TO POST SOMETHING LIKE "2.6.9"
AS AN ANSWER TO GITHUB'S LEARNING LAB ON
MANAGING SECURITY VULNERABILITIES, **YOU ARE
IN THE WRONG PLACE**.

이곳은 Github 보안 과정에 대한 답변을 게시하는
곳이 아닙니다! 여기에 "2.6.9"와 같은 답변을
제출하면 잘못 입력한 것입니다! 여기에 답변을
게시하면 영구적으로 차단됩니다!

Please go back and read the instructions again.
Posting such things here WILL GET YOU BANNED
FROM THE REPOSITORY PERMANENTLY. THIS IS NOT
WHERE YOU POST ANSWERS.

---------------------------------------------

I've notified Github about this but they
refuse to do anything about it. I apologize
to anyone trying to post an *actual* issue.
